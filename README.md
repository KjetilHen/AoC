# Advent Of Code

My adventures of the Advent Of Code challenges. Code examples are seperated by year then day then also in part 1 & 2. 
Each year also has a data folder. The data folder contains all test inputs and the real inputs as a .txt file.

To run the code you'll need nodejs and then type the following in a command line
````  
node <path>/day_<part>.js
````
